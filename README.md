# Comp330 CPD Weekly Reports
## Week 1 - Mon 24th September
### Comp310 - Intro lecture to module and assembly:
Been messing around with easy 6502 site, like the idea of using more logic than knowledge to program a game. Need to come up with an idea for a breakdown game. Going to start contributing to the Wiki early, only have a couple of weeks.
### Comp320 - Intro to dissertation project:
Whiteboarded idea for dissertation to visualise what I was doing, managed to scope down the project into a more feasable idea with stat and task tracking. Gathered 12 relevant papers, seems like this project hasn't been done before with some projects resembling large touchscreen taskboards which are far more expensive solutions to a wall and postit note taskboard.
### Comp330 - Portfolio/Career path lecture (x2):
Lots of ideas not reaching the prototype stage from designers refusing to work on somethings, I'm flexible, just need something to work on within scope. Started messing around with some nodeJS, would be nice to keep the dissertation and game in the same language as work so things I learn are transferrable. However, I think a nodeJS game would be too much work for myself.
## Week 2 - Mon 1st October
### Comp310 - Practical session with assembly:
Worked on fixing an existing controller, have a better understanding of assembly now, creating an efficient solution and one using a loop to see how that worked. Need to come up with an idea for a demake game to present on Thursday.
### Comp320 - Went through proposals:
Reading each others proposals, need to work on creating a question from my artefact idea. Have a better idea of what I'm going to do for my artefact.
### Comp330 - More on Javascript:
Worked more on NodeJS server, going to try and implement the graphics thing Garath mentioned but I forgot what it was. More prototyping for game project, but it doesn't feel like it's getting anywhere.
